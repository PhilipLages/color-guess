# Welcome to my Guess the Color project
<hr>

## Description:
For this project  at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/), I had to develop a page containing a game to select which color is being represented by the RGB text. 

The game has a points system, which gives the user 3 points if the guess is right.
